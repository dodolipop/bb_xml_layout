xmlLayout for BlackBerry OS5+
=============================

Introduction
------------

This is a small framework that allows the use of
XML layout on for BlackBerry OS5 and up.

The Goal is to keep it small and simple, and to do
*layouting* only. This means that this library will
not help you make pretty fields, but positioning
those fields on your screen will be easy.

Why use xmlLayout?
------------------

XML allows you to reuse a layout on different screens,
saving you a lot of time and repetitive code that is a
nightmare to debug. Using this framework will leave
your screen classes with a _lot_ less UI related code.

Also, XML is way easyer to write and debug than having
a few 100 VerticalFieldManagers stacked on top of each
other.

When to use xmlLayout?
----------------------

Whenever you have a Screen that has non trivial layout.
Easy screens should not be done with this, since the
overhead is too big.

How to use it?
--------------

Clone it right from here and set it up as a library
project. The source is distributed as eclipse project,
same holds true for the examples. I might add the library
as jar file later.

Where to get help?
------------------

For now, you can write me a message directly here on
github. Later, I might figure out something else.
